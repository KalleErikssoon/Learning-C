# Learning C Programming
### Introduction
This repository documents my journey in learning the C programming language and how this can be used in the current university course I am taking, called "Development of Embedded and Real-Time Systems". It includes various exercises and projects I will make during this journey.
### Goals and Objectives
Understand the basics of C syntax and structure.</br>
Develop an understanding of memory management in C.</br>
Build small projects to apply learned concepts.</br>
Understanding how programming in C can be used to develop embedded an real time systems.</br>
### Project Structure
week0/ - Learning basics of C, such as using command line arguments and using them in the small programs made for this week</br>
week1/ - Learning about various concepts in C, mainly about bitwise operators, arrays and pointers,</br> which were used in the programs made this week</br> 
week2/ - Learning about structs and enums, as well as file operations (in this case on binary files), as well as more pointers, arrays, bitwise operators, and conversions between decimal, binary, and hexadecimal </br>
week3/ - Learning and learning further about pointers and arrays/2d arrays and strings,and starting with TinkerCAD (making a simple program for using a Keypad connected to an arduino R3 with and without a library)
week4/ - Learning more about tinkerCAD, as well as pointers/arrays in C
week5/ - Learning more about bitwise operators
week6/ - More TinkerCAD, one basic program for a parking system using LED's/Buzzer to make noise/light up depending on distance (from an ultrasonic sensor) and some C String operations
week7/ - More C programming on strings, pointers, bitwise operators and arrays
